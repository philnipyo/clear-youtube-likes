Clear Youtube liked videos more easily!

I've noticed that whenever I tried to clear my liked Youtube videos, it was a complete hassle because you have to press the delete button for each individual video. The fact that the page reloads makes it even more annoying to do!

To address this, most people would write a simple script or bookmarklet to bulk remove liked videos. However, my intention is being able to selectively bulk delete videos via input checkboxes.
